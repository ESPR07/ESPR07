I thrive on learning new technologies and continuously improving my skills. \n\n My journey in front-end development has equipped me with a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as front-end frameworks and tools and I'm eager to apply my knowledge to real-world projects. When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring the latest industry trends, experimenting with new frameworks, or collaborating with fellow developers. My goal is to build visually appealing and highly functional websites that offer seamless user experiences. \n\n In Later time I've starting broadening my skillsets to not only create visually appealing and responsive front end but also work with back end API's and databases. \n\n Let's create something amazing together!",

Once the prototype was finalized, I moved to development, coding the website to meet the required user stories and ensuring full functionality. After testing, I successfully deployed the site, making it publicly accessible. This project gave me valuable experience in front-end development, project management, and user experience design.

The primary focus was to explore the utility-first CSS framework, Tailwind, to quickly style the interface while maintaining responsiveness and clean code. I implemented core auction features such as bidding, timers, and item listings. The use of Tailwind allowed for rapid development and a streamlined design process, while React handled the dynamic content and state management. The site’s clean, modern design and efficient user interface were key goals, and Tailwind helped achieve this with minimal custom CSS. This project enhanced my skills in both React and Tailwind, allowing me to deliver a polished, functional application.",
