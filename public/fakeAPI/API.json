I was tasked with creating a fully functional auction page based on a full 'life-like' assignment brief. Among the specifications was a set of user stories I had to fullfil and a list of allowed tools and frameworks. For this project I'm using Tailwind as a CSS Framework and GitHub Projects for planning, as well as Figma for prototype design. The alloted time given to complete the assignment was 6 weeks, but there ended up being a big backlog of features I wanted to add, but ended up not adding due to time constraint and a focus on what was asked for.",
