### Hi there üëã
Hello! I'm a 27 year old developer living in Norway with a passion and curiosity for anything IT related. I love solving problems and learning new things. Computers have been a passion of mine since I was a kid, everything from building computers physically to experimenting with different coding languages.

In my spare time I also like to go for walks in nature, excercise and play games. I'm currently a student at Noroff University College in a Front-End Course and am really enjoying it, so I will definetly say that I have a hunger to learn more in the field.
